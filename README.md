The Geography Files
===================

A collection of geographies for maps and such. Will try to keep descriptions in this readme, but ...

Also, these files are untested at this time.

## Descriptions

* `tl_2010_48_county10.geojson` Counties in Texas as of 2010. Projection is NAD83. Saved as geojson using QGIS from .shp from [TIGER/line](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html) of the same name.
* `tl_2014_us_county_texas.geojson` Counties of Texas for 2014. **Probably** no change from 2010. This was a save-as selection from the all counties in us file from 2014 TIGER/Line.
